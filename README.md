# Professional Chatbot Using LLaMA Model

![Professional Chatbot](chatbot.jpg)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a highly interactive and professional chatbot using the **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)** model via an API. The chatbot is designed to simulate natural conversations with users, providing coherent and contextually relevant responses. The chatbot interface is developed using **Streamlit**, a powerful web framework that allows for rapid UI development, while the model API is integrated to handle the natural language processing tasks.

The repository contains all the necessary files to set up the chatbot, including the Python script (`app.py`), images for customization, and a `requirements.txt` file detailing the dependencies.

## Features

- **LLaMA Model Integration**: The chatbot utilizes the LLaMA model from Hugging Face via API, making it capable of delivering accurate and context-aware responses.
- **Streamlit-Based UI**: A dynamic and intuitive user interface built using Streamlit ensures that the chatbot interactions are smooth and engaging.
- **CSS Customization**: The chatbot interface incorporates custom themes, CSS, and HTML for an attractive and professional look.
- **Static Input Box & Send Button**: The input box and send button are fixed at the bottom of the screen, offering a seamless user experience while the chat scrolls dynamically above.
- **Enhanced Responsiveness**: The chatbot UI is designed to be responsive, making it accessible across different screen sizes and devices.

## Files Included

- **app.py**: This is the main script that initializes the chatbot interface using Streamlit and integrates the LLaMA model for conversation processing.
- **requirements.txt**: Contains the list of dependencies, including `streamlit`, `requests`, and other necessary libraries to ensure smooth setup and functioning of the app.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project, explaining setup instructions, usage, and feature highlights.
- **Images**: 
  - `Glows.jpeg`, `lion.jpeg`, and other images are included to provide a visually appealing background and layout for the chatbot interface.
  - These images add aesthetic value, making the interface look modern and user-friendly.

## Key Components

1. **Chatbot Logic**:
   - The core of the chatbot is powered by the LLaMA model, which handles all user queries and generates responses based on context.
   
2. **Streamlit Interface**:
   - The frontend is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive, real-time web application.
   - CSS and HTML modifications are applied for a sleek, professional look.

3. **User Experience (UX)**:
   - The input box is always fixed at the bottom of the page, allowing the user to submit queries without scrolling, even as chat history grows.
   - The chat history is displayed in a scrollable container above the input area, allowing users to review past conversations easily.
